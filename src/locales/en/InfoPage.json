While sampling at farm also allows a detailed collection of information on farm size, husbandry system and age of the animals and reflects well the German situation, the decisions 2013/652/EU and its successor 2020/1729/EU provide for sampling at the slaughterhouse. Here, the consideration of animals from other countries slaughtered in Germany is explicitly excluded. Since the availability of data on the farm of production at slaughter is usually limited, it therefore does not replace sampling in primary production. Furthermore, sampling at the slaughterhouse best reflects the entry into food processing and takes into account possible colonization or infection up to the time of removal of the animals from the farm and during transport to the slaughterhouse."

Sampling of retail food as it enters directly into the household of the end consumer best reflects the entry into the household and thus the exposure of the consumer. In addition to retail in the narrower sense, direct marketers (as a retail type), wholesalers (including wholesale markets), if applicable, and import points or border control points are allowed as sampling points for this purpose. This applies if they produce food for delivery to the end consumer or if the food is already present there in the final packaging for delivery to the consumer's household. However, in accordance with the Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU or its successor regulation 2020/1729/EU, the consideration of samples from wholesale trade is not permitted."

Sampling at the slaughterhouse best reflects entry into food processing and thus, takes into account possible colonization or infection up to the time of removal of the animals from the producer's premises and during transport to the slaughterhouse. Samples taken in accordance with Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU or its successor regulation 2020/1729/EU originate from animals fattened and slaughtered in Germany.For data protection reasons, it is not possible to select the federal state of origin for isolates from poultry obtained at the slaughterhouse."

In addition to the retail in the narrower sense, direct marketers (as a retail type), wholesalers (including wholesale markets), if applicable, as well as import points or border control points are permitted as sampling locations for this purpose. This applies under the condition that food is produced for delivery to the end consumer or already in the final packaging for delivery to the consumer's household. However, in accordance with the criteria for the Implementing Decision 2013/652/EU and the successor 2020/1729/EU, the inclusion of samples of broiler meat, pork and beef from wholesale is not permitted.
